      <h2><a name="Setting_Ladders">Setting Up the Ladders</a></h2>
      <p class="text">So you’ve gotten as far as downloading, moving and unpacking the software files. You’ve successfully pointed your browser to this page. We’ll get to the more technical aspects further down. For now, let’s make sure you have ladders that will load without issues into your database… </p>
      <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="Creating_Ladders">Creating Compatible Ladders</a></h3>
      <p class="text">Yearbook advisers plan out their yearbooks inside spreadsheet files called ladders. A basic setup contains the book’s page order, book section, page deadlines, names of section editors, and staffers assigned to take photographs and write copy for each page. This section assumes you already have an Excel spreadsheet with your book’s pages planned out. These next steps involve ordering your ladder’s columns correctly so it can be uploaded into the database without issues. </p>
      <ol class="text">
        <li>Make sure your vertical columns have headers. You can label them any way you want, as long as they describe the columns’ contents.</li>
        <li>If your horizontal rows have headers on the left, leave them empty, but place a header at the top of that first column. If you instead have vital data in the first column (A), carefully select the entire table’s contents and move one column to the right, then type a placeholder header above column A. The first column must remain empty or contain irrelevant data to accomodate the database’s row ID numbering.</li>
        <li>Next, order the columns this way from left to right:</li>
      </ol>
      <pre>Page # | Section Name | Page Name | Due Date | Editor | Email</pre>
      <p class="text">This means selecting an entire column from header to final entry, grabbing the edge when the mouse cursor becomes a gloved hand, and moving it to an empty space, then rearranging as needed. Be careful that your columns stay together and you do not erase any other columns.
      <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="Formatting_Dates">Formatting the Due Dates</a></h3>
      <p class="text">The database is picky about dates, which must be in the <strong>YYYY-MM-DD</strong> format. Anything else will not function. The most common format is <strong>dd/mm/yyyy</strong>, or even a two-digit <strong>yy</strong> for the year. Excel should be able to interpret the column as date data, which means you can reformat it without a problem. Select the date column and do this:</p>
      <ol class="text">
        <li>Go to <strong>Format Cells</strong> and then the <strong>Number</strong> tab.</li>
        <li>Select <strong>Date</strong></li>
        <li>Change the Locale to English (U.K.)</li>
        <li>Select the fifth item on the list (2010-03-05 or similar)</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="text">Check all your dates to make sure the conversion was successful.</p>
      <p class="text">If you’re on a Mac, you can use the latest version of the free Numbers spreadsheet app to do the same. Select the entire date column, then in the Inspector panel on the right, click the Cell tab. Under Data Format, set the drop down menu to Date &amp; Time, and for Date, choose the final item in the drop down (2017-01-05 or similar). Leave Time set to None.</p>
      <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="Saving_Spreadsheets">Saving and Exporting the Spreadsheets</a></h3>
      <p class="text">The app will use&nbsp;three ladders, one for your page deadlines, and the other two for keeping track of copy and photo deadlines. You can duplicate your existing ladder with a Save As… under two new files, one for copy and photo deadlines. These two ladders will also need an extra column for the names of the copy writers and photographers. In the copy ladder, select the email header and move it to the next column to the right. Label the empty column header to the left of the email header Writer or similar. Do the same in the photo ladder, and set the header to the left of the email header to Photographer or similar. Save each ladder.</p>
      <p class="text">Keep in mind that copy and photo ladders won’t have assignments for every page. For example, you don’t need copy and photos for the senior commemoratives or index section. It will be very helpful to remove any such pages from these ladders before adding them to your database.</p>
      <p class="text">The app can only import spreadsheets saved as comma-separated values, or CSV, into the database. You simply have to perform another Save As… in Excel, then change the Format to CSV at the bottom of the save window. In Numbers, go to <b>File &gt; Export</b>, then choose CSV.</p>

      <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="Activating_Server">Activating the Server and Adjusting Its Settings</a></h3>
      <p class="text"> Others have documented the process of setting up a local machine more thoroughly, so I will point you to a very good <a href="https://coolestguidesontheplanet.com/get-apache-mysql-php-and-phpmyadmin-working-on-macos-sierra/" target="_blank">setup tutorial here</a>. You’ll leave this page open in a separate tab so you can come back to it when you’re finished with the instructions there. If you have installed this software on a dedicated web hosting service, you can skip to the bottom of the <a href="https://coolestguidesontheplanet.com/get-apache-mysql-php-and-phpmyadmin-working-on-macos-sierra/#phpmyadmin" target="_blank">phpMyAdmin section</a> and begin administering the database immediately from the web host’s administrator login. <b>Tip:</b> Use the instructions for the Document root setup— they’re much quicker and easier.
      <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="Configuring_App">Configure the App</a></h3>
      <p class="text">From here on down the setup instructions for a web host or a local machine are identical. First, navigate to the <a href="installation/index.php" target="_blank">initial setup page</a> where you’ll enter the necessary parameters that allow the app to work with the database. Remember: you’re entering the username and password you used to launch the database server, <strong>not</strong> your computer’s login info. If you entered everything successfully you will see the message <strong>The database is connected</strong> upon clicking the “Set Up the Database” button and a link to the page to create tables. If there is an error, reload the page and re-enter your info, double-checking to see if it is correct. If you still hit a roadblock, the likeliest problem is the database is not running. On a local machine, open the Terminal, copy and paste these lines into the window, and press Return, typing the computer admin password as prompted.
      <pre>sudo mkdir /var/run/mysqld
sudo chown -R mysql:mysql /var/run/mysqld
sudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server start</pre>
      <p class="text">If it appears the database is running, use phpMyAdmin’s root login to diagnose user permissions.</p>
      <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="Creating_Tables">Creating the Database Tables</a></h3>
      <p class="text">The next page does the heavy lifting of creating the database tables that will hold all the necessary data. You’ll notice that it refers to creating tables for the following year. This is done under the assumption that you are planning for the yearbook that will be released at the end of the upcoming school year. If you need to change it, click the “Change Year” button, and select from either the current year or the year following the default. Once you click the “Create Tables” button, a link will appear that directs you to the registration page, where you can create an account, then be able to login to the app for the first time. If you will also be the administrator, fill in the name field exactly as you did on the first page, otherwise you will have no control over the app and will have to start the process over again.</p>
      <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="Importing_Ladders">Importing the Ladders into the Database</a></h3>
      <p class="text">Next to the welcome message on the main page is a link to the Ladder Admin page, which is divided into two parts, Upload and Download. To upload your CSV files, simply choose which kind of ladder you are uploading from the drop down menu and browse for the correct file. If you duplicated your section ladder files, you’ll have the same due dates for copy and photos, and you <em><strong>really</strong></em> want those resources ready well <em><strong>before</strong></em> pages are due. When I was an adviser, I demanded revised and proofread copy a week before, and photos taken and edited 10 days before. You can choose to offset up to two weeks (14 days) before page due dates from the drop down menu here.</p>
      <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="Editing_Files">Editing Ladders</a></h3>
      <p class="text">It’s not uncommon for ladders to change several times over the course of a year (revise deadlines, change page  content, or even students assigned to tasks), so you have the ability to edit your ladders directly in the web browser. Simply click in any cell that allows editing, update the information, then press Tab to move your cursor outside the cell. In the Section Ladder, you can edit page numbers, page names and due dates. In the Photo and Copy ladders, you can make these changes and also edit names of students assigned to tasks. However, there are some cautions:      
      <ul>
        <li class="text">The Section Ladder cross-references those students assigned to write copy or shoot photos by common page number. If you change page numbers and/or page names on one ladder, make sure you update your other two ladders with the same changes as well, or your assignments may no longer match</li>
        <li class="text">Changing students assigned to copy or photo assignments should <b>only</b> be done after a deadline passes, and a different student than the assignee has completed a task. If you change a student before deadline and are using the deadline email system, the wrong student’s email will end up being used to send an alert of an impending deadline. If you must change the assignee prior to deadline, clear the assignment,  have the new assignee apply for the task and finalize the assignment as <a href="#Finalizing_Tasks">outlined in the last paragraph here</a></li>
        <li class="text">If you change due dates anywhere, you will change the number of offset days between copy and photo deadlines and their corresponding page deadlines. Check all due dates to make sure they maintain the offsets you have already established. My advice is to only change due dates to allow a student more time to complete a difficult assignment and not be penalized</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="Downloading_Files">Downloading Ladder Files</a></h3>
       <p class="text">If, for example, you wish to make printed copies of your ladders, you can download them  as comma-separated tables from the same Ladder Admin page for uploading files, then open them and print from any spreadsheet app. Saving regular backup copies of your data is also good practice, in the unlikely case that disaster strikes. You can even edit downloaded files in Excel, Numbers, etc., and upload them again if you prefer, replacing the outdated versions. Just make sure you save a csv version of your work before you do so, and that you observe the cautions about deadlines discussed in the Editing Ladders section above.
     </p>
       </p>
      <p class="text"><strong>Tip</strong>: It’s always good practice to apply your edits to a duplicate file, saving the original downloaded version <strong><em>just in case</em></strong> you accidentally edit and upload the wrong ladder (replace your photo ladder with your copy ladder, for example). This will keep you from losing all your work and starting over.</p>
      <h2><a name="Setting_Accounts">Setting Up Student Accounts and Tasks</a></h2>
      <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="Registering_Students">Registering Students</a></h3>
      <p class="text">Now it’s time to bring your staffers and editors into the mix. The first step is to direct students to the registration page. The address depends on whether you are working from a web host or local server. If a web host, the browser address will be similar to:</p>
      <p class="text">example.com/app4yb/register.php</p>
      <p class="text">On a web host, you would simply substitute the example.com for the site’s domain name. On a local server, it’s the server’s numerical IP address. If you are running on a local server, the email function will not work, but you will still need  students to fill in something as an email address. The reason is that the app uses this information to tag filled assignments, but it doesn’t have to be a valid email. Upon a successful registry, they can use the link to the login page to enter the app. Because they are not administrators, they will see a simplified version of the home page.</p>
      <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="Assigning_Students">Assigning Students</a></h3>
      <p class="text">At this point, the school year is in its first days. Now begins the fun of giving out positions and assignments. For me, handing out editorships was already done by the end of the previous school year, but you may not have had that luxury. Nevertheless, assigning editors to a dozen or so sections is far easier than assigning a hundred or more copy and photo assignments, and this is where <strong>app4yb</strong> will shine. You will save hours of editing spreadsheets to finalize student tasks by using its interactive features.</p>
      <h4><a name="Assigning_Editors">Assigning Page/Section Editors</a></h4>
      <p class="text">Students responsible for assembling pages from copy, captions and photos are your section editors. They may include editors-in-chief, those students at the top of the chain of command. These should be entered first. At the link “Finalize Page Assignments” on the admin home page, you will first encounter a drop down listing all your book’s sections, as determined by the section ladder file you already uploaded. Choosing a section will reveal two kinds of lists of all students who have currently registered. Need One Editor is a drop down where you can select a single section editor. Some lengthy or high profile sections may require several editors, so you can also click on the “Need Multiple Editors” tab and control-click (Windows) or command-click (Mac) the editors you need. A confirmation message will scroll out beneath the form to insure you have everything correct before submitting. Sections where editors are already assigned are noted with an asterisk *, and a list of assignments will appear and lengthen at the bottom of the page to keep track of them at a glance.</p>
      <h4><a name="Unassigning_Editors">Unassigning Editors</a></h4>
      <p class="text">Should it become necessary to change editors, you can clear any assignments without having to download, edit, and upload ladder files. Each menu containing names also has a blank choice at the bottom. Select it and the confirmation message informs you the assignment will be cleared upon submission. You can then reassign the section at once.</p>
      <h4><a name="Choosing_Tasks">Choosing Copy/Photo Tasks</a></h4>
      <p class="text">Giving students a sense of control is very motivational. Allowing your staffers to pick which copy and photo assignments they wish to cover reinforces that. Knowing well in advance when their deadlines fall also helps them plan ahead and prepare to finish on time, so the sooner assignments are given out the better. This is where the Choose Copy… and Choose Photo Assignments links come in.</p>
      <p class="text">Each page taps into your copy or photo ladders and displays them with a checkbox next to each page’s name. Section editor names, if assigned, will appear in the rightmost column. Staffers simply check off all the assignments they might like to cover, then submit by clicking the Accept Choices button at the top. To make sure you have spread assignments to pages that students may not feel obligated to cover, establish quotas for the number of assignments each student chooses from every section of the book.</p>
      <h4><a name="Finalizing_Tasks">Finalizing Copy/Photo Tasks</a></h4>
      <p class="text">Now comes the job of winnowing down each copy and photo assignment to the staffers you wish to complete them. A quick visit to the Copy Assignments and Photo Assignments links will display the names of every student who signed up for each assignment. High profile pages such as Homecoming week, varsity football or pageant coverage will likely display a huge stack of willing participants. I used to spend countless hours poring over spreadsheets trying to pick the most capable staffers while also making sure an equitable number of tasks was given to everyone. The Finalize Copy… and Finalize Photo Assignments pages will allow you to work quickly and stay organized, too.</p>
      <p class="text">Both pages work similarly to the page where you assigned section editors. Two important differences are that after selecting a section, you then drop down a menu containing that section’s entire range of page names. After choosing a page, every staffer who signed up for that page displays in the third drop down. As with assigning section editors, the page to finalize photo tasks allows for multiple staffers to receive a photo assignment. The reason this ability is not available in the page to finalize copy is that I believe writing is an essentially solitary task. It is collaborative in the sense that proofreading by others is vital to minimizing errors, but placing several students in charge of completing a copy assignment is an overcomplication of accountability and assessment that you should avoid.</p>
      <p class="text">As you submit each assignment you’ll see two lists build at the bottom. On the left is a list similar to what you saw in the page for assigning editors. On the right is the number of unclaimed or empty assignments and a running count of how many each student has so far.</p>
      <p class="text">As with finalizing page editors, you can clear assignments by choosing the blank at the bottom of each drop down. Unlike the section page, students must reapply for the assignment from the Choose… page for their names to show up. Once they have, you can then finalize the choice.</p>
      <h4><a name="Cutting_Choices">Cutting Off Assignment Choices</a></h4>
      <p class="text">You may discover some assignments are left wanting after the first go-round. After assigning staffers to all the pages you can, direct any students still short of assignments to revisit the Choose pages… to sweep up unfilled ones. The good thing here is all assigned pages will become invisible and only unfilled assignments will remain, as long you’ve set a cutoff date for choosing assignments, and that date has passed.</p>
      <p class="text">Once all staffers have been able to select their desired assignments, you want to limit the ability to return to this page after you have finalized tasks, or mischief-makers will undo your hard work. In the lower right corner of the home page is a section informing you of upcoming deadlines, and a Change button under <strong>Deadline to choose assignments</strong>. The default is 1 September. Clicking Change will reveal drop downs to reset to the month and date of your choice in the same calendar year. Once this date has passed, the Choose Copy and Photo Assignments pages will only display unclaimed assignments. You can direct a staffer to those pages to claim a cleared copy or photo assignment as well.</p>
      <h2 class="tutorial"><a name="Deadline_Fulfill">Deadline Fulfillment and Tracking</a></h2>
      <p class="text">Staffers will fulfill copy and photo assignments in the app in very different ways. Here we review each one.</p>
      <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="Completing_Copy">Completing Copy Assignments</a></h3>
      <p class="text">In the course of running a yearbook program, I realized students had an increasingly difficult time with the concept of blocking paragraphs. Additionally, students would often save stories composed in word processing programs in cryptic locations that left editors and advisers scrambling when deadlines arrived. What, you too? Well, app4yb has a solution built right in!</p>
      <p class="text">A well-formed yearbook story will have an attention-getting lead sentence in an introductory paragraph, followed by a thoughtful quote from an individual relevant to the story’s subject. The story then alternates between lead-in paragraphs that set up subsequent quotes, each in their own paragraphs. Teaching copy writers how to compose good questions for questionnaires or interviews is vital beforehand. Once questions and answers are gathered, the actual copywriting can begin. Direct staffers to click the <strong>Add a story</strong> link to do so.</p>
      <p class="text"><strong>Note:</strong> If you aren’t clear about it, some staffers may mistake the story composition page for a place to write questionnaires. Make sure they understand the distinction. Have them use Word or a similar app to compose and print questionnaires first.</p>
      <p class="text">The <b>First Draft Story Editor</b> helps copywriters separate out lead-ins and quotes into singular fields that will compose paragraphs. Above the fields are a button to update word count, a drop down to select the story title, and confirmation of the story author’s name. The drop down will only display that staffer’s assigned stories, and once the story is submitted, that story disappears from the drop down, leaving only unwritten stories upon the staffer’s next visit. Should a staffer forget to choose a story title and the story is submitted, an error message directs her or him to return to the page with an Undo link. Using the Undo link is identical to hitting the browser’s Back button, and the story remains in the fields. Make sure your staff understands that if they encounter this error and reload the page instead of clicking Undo, their work will <strong>not</strong> be saved!</p>
      <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="Revising_Copy">Revising Copy Assignments</a></h3>
      <p class="text">Even the greatest writers improve upon rough drafts. Push your copywriters to understand that revision makes them better.</p>
      <p class="text">Upon submission, either you or a Copy Editor will want to proofread and mark copy for correction. The View and Edit a story link will take you to a page displaying all copy assignments submitted to date. If you’re at the point where lots of stories have been written, you may find it handy to search the page by author or story name. You can filter by author by choosing from the drop down and clicking the Go button. A list of links to all stories appears below the drop down in order of submission from most recent. Under each story entry are three links. If you are the story’s author, an <strong>Edit Now</strong> link is visible, otherwise this line informs you that you have No Access. Then there are links to <strong>Print</strong> and to <strong>Return to Top</strong> of the page.</p>
      <p class="text">The Print link takes you to a page where the story is isolated from the others. Clicking the <b>Print this page</b> link or choosing the browser’s Print command will allow you to commit the story to paper in a large, readable font, with plenty of line spacing to write proof correction marks. The story author can then click the Edit Now link from her/his login, type the necessary changes, and submit the updated version. Then all a section editor has to do to include the story in a page is copy and paste!</p>
      <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="Changing_Counts">Changing Minimum Word Counts</a></h3>
      <p class="text">The First Draft Story Editor allows a writer to get an accurate word count as a story is composed, so a copy block does not fall short in spacing requirements for the page design. The <b>View and Edit a story</b> page displays both the minimum word count and the current word count under each story. Depending on your choice of font, type size, and page design, you may want longer or shorter copy blocks. The <b>View and Edit a story</b> page has a drop down for the administrator to set the required word count (the default is 200, which can be changed from 150 to 300).</p>
      <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="Completing_Photos">Completing Photo Assignments</a></h3>
      <p class="text">Fulfilling a photo assignment requires a simple upload of a representative photo file for a particular assignment. Clicking the <b>Upload a photo</b> link allows any assigned photographer to upload a photo to the database. This reflects as a completed task, and the assignment is removed from the drop down menu, just as the story editor works. This assumes, of course, that the batch of photos taken for the assignment exists in a location accessible to both you and the page editor who needs them, and that the photographer did not just upload any old photo file to beat a deadline. The upload page allows only <b>jpg</b> or <b>png</b> files to transfer.</p>
      <p class="text"><b>Note:</b> An administrator will also find a <b>LOGO UPLOAD</b> assignment in the drop down. This allows you to replace the generic logo image at the top right with a custom logo if you so desire. The best images should be transparent-edged <b>png</b> images, sized to about 400 pixels in width and 250 in height to fit nicely into the page header. If you wish to keep the original, however, change its file name first, because any upload will overwrite it.</p>
      <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="Checking_Deadlines">Checking for Missed Deadlines</a></h3>
      <p class="text">The app will instantly alert you to missed deadlines by highlighting past due dates in red on your copy or photo ladder pages. The Check Missed Copy… or Check Missed Photo Deadlines links will list all missed deadlines for up to 3 weeks past due.</p>
      <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="What_Deadlines">What About Page Deadlines?</a></h3>
      <p class="text">Yearbook pages are assembled in a variety of ways. Some use page design software such as Adobe InDesign or Quark XPress. Most yearbook printers also have online portals to build yearbook pages. Because yearbook printers are the ultimate arbiters for deciding when a set number of pages are due at their plant, the app does not help you keep track of completed pages beyond informing you of their composition deadlines. The understanding is that you or your editors-in-chief are tracking this in tandem with your printer, and that if copy and photo deadlines are being met well in advance, as app4yb is designed to help you do, page deadlines will fall into place as well.</p>

      <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="Writing_Captions">Writing Captions</a></h3>
      <p class="text">Photographers aren’t off the hook once they turn in their set of pictures for an assignment (or they shouldn’t be!). After section editors decide on which photos will be used on a page, faces still have to be identified, the contexts of  photos should be ascertained, and all this must be written into photo captions. Pictures may be worth a thousand words, but that doesn’t mean they tell the whole story, especially when memories fade into the past.</p>
      <p class="text">A good caption should identify the people in a photo, describe what is happening, and then add elaboration in a second sentence. A few examples:</p>
      <ul class="text" style="list-style-type:disc; padding-left:3em;">
        <li>Coach Sam Ochoa yells encouragement to his team in a match against the Montview Mudhens. The Catfish defeated the Mudhens 71-32, with senior guard Magic Johnson scoring 47 points.</li>
        <li>Juniors Shannon Lozano and Suzanne McMann run for the Cross Country team. The Cross Country team practiced hard day by day to improve their technique.</li>
        <li>Showing their spirit, sophomores Max Hernandez and Alissa Heinz   finish the race. “Pipe line is the hardest run our team goes on,” Hernandez said.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text">The caption writing page is set up similarly to the copy page, in that it displays separate fields for composing, in this case to define sentences for first identifying and describing, and secondly for elaboration. You can compose up to five different captions in this manner. To the right of the fields are style rules I had my staffers follow to maintain consistency, which are all reflected in the examples above. There is also a link to a popup page that contains helpful hints for what elaborations can include.</p>
      <p class="text">I used a variation of “tell us in 25 words or less” as a mnemonic for my staffers to remember how long good captions should be (without the <em>or less</em> part!). The View captions page displays minimum word counts, which an administrator can change from the default 120 (which averages out to 2 dozen words per caption). Caption writers can use the Update… button at the top to keep track as they work.</p>
      <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="Using_Notes">Using Photo Notes</a></h3>
      <p class="text">The Upload Photos page has a field to attach a note to the file. This might include some simple facts such as the date or location of the shot, or a game’s final score, that the section editor may find helpful. When photos are chosen for inclusion on a page and the task for writing captions falls upon the photographer, the section editor may need a quick way to communicate which photo files must be captioned, such as a list of file names or the location of the folder containing those files. Clicking the word Notes under an entry on the Available Photos page allows updating, adding to, or entering this information in a simple popup window. Be brief, as there is a 210 character limit to each note (the length of 1.5 full tweets), and a red alert will display when exceeded.</p>
      <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="Deadline_Emails">Deadline Emails</a></h3>
      <p class="text">If you run app4yb on a web host, you can take advantage of the web server’s sendmail function to alert editors, copy writers, and photographers about imminent deadlines via the email addresses staffers entered when registering. The Deadline Emails link on the home page will display a list of all deadlines between 5 days and 3 weeks out, referencing those responsible for each. After review, emails are sent upon clicking <b>OK to Send</b>. Depending on the number of emails, it may take a few seconds for the resulting page to completely acknowledge all emails were sent. If staffers need to communicate with you, the reply to email address is the adviser’s / administrator’s email.</p>
      <p class="text"><b>Note:</b> Email texts are generic enough to apply to most circumstances. Only attempt to edit the page code to customize the message if you are experienced, or modify and test the code outside the running app to prevent breaking the app. </p>
      <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="Web_Calendars">Web Calendars</a></h3>
      <p class="text">Ladder pages can be sorted by date (click the Due Date column heading) if you need to view your deadlines in chronological order. If you find various calendar apps useful, app4yb includes a modified version of phpicalendar, an open source web calendar application, for viewing deadlines in calendar format. The administrator’s home page contains an <b>Update Web Cals</b> link that exports ladders from the database as files readable by calendar apps. Clicking it will generate the files and display a link to the calendar itself. Navigating the calendar is simple, with links and menus for displaying the day, week, month or year of your choice. Deadlines for each ladder appear as clickable events, which display details in popup windows. A popup’s Attendee line shows the names of those responsible as email links for quickly messaging them through an email client such as Microsoft Outlook or Apple Mail. Choosing a specific calendar also contains links to Subscribe or Download ladders for viewing in any ics-compatible calendar application!</p>
      <p class="text"><b>Notes: 1)</b> Deadlines are arranged in hourly increments for easier viewing than all-day events. The times given them are random. <b>2)</b> The calendar is not password-protected as are the app’s pages. If you post
      a link to the calendar on a public page outside the app, you may expose it to robots that scour the web for email addresses, increasing the likelihood that you and your students see an increase in spam emails.</p>
      <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="Student_Locator">Student Locator</a></h3>
      <p class="text">This is a feature I built around my district’s data retrieval system. It may only work for you if you are able to extract information about each of your school’s students in comma-separated format:</p>
      <pre>Last | First | Period | ID | Grade | Teacher | Room</pre>
      <p class="text">Depending on your school’s enrollment and scheduling, the resulting spreadsheet could contain thousands of rows (# of students multiplied by # of periods). Each row must run through each student’s schedule from first to last period, then move to the next student, and so on. If you succeed in getting it to work, it can be an invaluable resource for not only locating students for quick retrieval of quotes, pictures, etc., but also to spell check names. An autocomplete feature is built in, and displays suggestions upon entering the first 3 letters so misspelled names do not return empty results.</p>
