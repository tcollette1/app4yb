**app4yb** is a web application I wrote around 2015-2016 to help high school yearbook teachers keep track of their copy, photo, and page deadlines over the course of a school year. It utilizes a mySQL database to store user accounts and deadline spreadsheets, save copy assignments and photo captions, send email alerts to staffers about upcoming deadlines, and alert admins about missed deadlines. It has been tested only as far as PHP 7.3. Interactive widgets require access to jQuery code. Notable features include ability to generate .ics files for displaying deadlines in an iCalendar client, compatibility with .csv files for importing/exporting to/from spreadsheet applications such as Excel or Numbers, tutorials for writing copy and captions and taking photos, ability to print copy for markup, uploading sample photos from completed assignments, filtering for names of contributors, and even a method to display student schedules to locate students during different class periods. Instructions for installation and use are spelled out in the **installation.html** file.

**Known Issues**

The calendar feature links to an installation of PHP iCalendar, which is not included in this repository, and has not been supported for a decade or more. An adept coder can perhaps reverse engineer it to accommodate another PHP calendar app.
