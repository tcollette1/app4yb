**app4yb** is a web application I wrote around 2015-2016 to help high school yearbook teachers keep track of their copy, photo, and page deadlines over the course of a school year. It utilizes a mySQL database to store user accounts and deadline spreadsheets, save copy assignments and photo captions, and alert admins about missed deadlines. It has been tested only as far as PHP 7.3.
